# 1. Use Nginx (Alpine version is very small and fast)
FROM nginx:alpine

# 2. Copy your frontend files to the default Nginx public folder
#    This takes everything in your 'Reactjs' folder and puts it where Nginx looks for files
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

# 3. Expose port 80 (standard web traffic port)
EXPOSE 80

# 4. Start Nginx when the container runs
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
